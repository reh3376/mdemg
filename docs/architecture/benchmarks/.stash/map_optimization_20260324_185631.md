## Question-Level Detail (Final Iteration)


### uxts_frameworks

| # | Difficulty | Score | Question | Reason |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | factual | 10 PASS | Which frameworks are merge-blocking in CI? | The agent correctly listed all four frameworks and their corresponding merge-blocking criteria without missing any details. |
| 2 | factual | 7 PASS | How many UATS specs and variants exist? | The agent correctly stated the number of specs and variants but omitted the critical fact about the 318 test cases. |
| 3 | relational | 9 PASS | Why is UVTS not CI-gated? | The agent correctly identifies the runner demotion due to GAP-04 and the need for inline grading before CI activation, but slightly rephrases and omits the detail about producing false passes. |
| 4 | factual | 2 **WEAK** | Which framework has no runner at all? | The agent's answer is fundamentally incorrect and does not address the question about UAMS (GAP-21) properly. |
| 5 | factual | 8 PASS | What is the UETS framework for? | The agent correctly identifies the evaluation focus on LLM emergence concept-naming quality but adds the UETS framework without explanation, which is a minor detail not in the ground truth. |
| 6 | factual | 10 PASS | Which frameworks use soft-fail CI gating? | The agent correctly listed all frameworks using soft-fail CI gating with accurate descriptions and no omissions. |
