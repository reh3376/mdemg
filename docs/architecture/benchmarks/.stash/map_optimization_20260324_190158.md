## Question-Level Detail (Final Iteration)


### dep_pkg_graph

| # | Difficulty | Score | Question | Reason |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | factual | 10 PASS | Which packages are leaf packages with no dependencies? | The agent correctly listed all the leaf packages with no internal dependencies exactly as in the ground truth. |
| 2 | factual | 9 PASS | What does the api package depend on? | The agent's answer is accurate and complete except for the missing "lrn" package in the list. |
| 3 | relational | 8 PASS | Why does ret depend on plg? | The answer correctly identifies the dependency and fallback role of MatchIngestionModule but lacks explicit mention of its core functionality. |
| 4 | relational | 9 PASS | Which package does hid depend on for emergence naming? | The agent correctly identifies the dependency of "hid" on "llm" for emergence naming but adds unnecessary detail about the package "hid." |
| 5 | relational | 9 PASS | What does grd depend on emb for? | The agent correctly identifies embedding-based similarity search for constraint retrieval but uses informal phrasing and slightly lacks clarity. |
