## Question-Level Detail (Final Iteration)


### uxts_frameworks

| # | Difficulty | Score | Question | Reason |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | factual | 10 PASS | Which frameworks are merge-blocking in CI? | The agent correctly listed all four frameworks and provided accurate descriptions for each. |
| 2 | factual | 7 PASS | How many UATS specs and variants exist? | The agent correctly identified the number of specs and variants but omitted the critical fact about the 318 test cases. |
| 3 | relational | 9 PASS | Why is UVTS not CI-gated? | The agent correctly identifies the runner is demoted due to missing inline grading and the CI gating status, but slightly over-explains with map details not in the ground truth. |
| 4 | factual | 10 PASS | Which framework has no runner at all? | The agent correctly states that UAMS has no runner implementation and references GAP-21, matching the ground truth fully. |
| 5 | factual | 7 PASS | What is the UETS framework for? | The agent correctly identifies the UETS framework's purpose related to emergence evaluation of LLM concept-naming quality but does not explicitly mention "Evaluating LLM emergence concept-naming quality" as the core task. |
| 6 | factual | 10 PASS | Which frameworks use soft-fail CI gating? | The agent correctly listed all frameworks using soft-fail CI gating with accurate descriptions and no missing information. |
